I focused on the maintenance and improvement of SuperOffice-CRM-Modules, as well as the development of custom solutions to meet client requirements. I worked closely with users to identify pain points and bottlenecks within the system, and then utilized my technical expertise to develop and improve components within the CRM.

By leveraging my experience in development, I was able to create customized solutions that helped clients streamline their processes, increase efficiency, and enhance their overall productivity.

I am passionate about using my skills and experience to help businesses achieve their goals, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and learn new skills.
