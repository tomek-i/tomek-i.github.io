As a Senior Software Engineer at SSW, I have been at the forefront of leading and modernizing internal and client-facing software projects. In my role as Tech Lead, I spearheaded the migration of the SugarLearning application from a legacy .NET 4.2 framework to the latest .NET 8, a significant milestone that involved growing and managing a team dedicated to delivering high-quality features and fixes.

In addition to technical leadership, I have played a crucial role as Scrum Master, facilitating Agile ceremonies across multiple teams, including SSW TV and FirebootCamp. My work in FirebootCamp extended beyond typical development tasks as I trained interns in both technical skills (Angular, .NET) and soft skills, preparing them for real-world software development challenges.

I have also contributed to key client projects such as Arriba, where I implemented new features in a legacy VB.NET application, and BizCover, where I provided strategic guidance to restructure their team and optimized their system architecture by transitioning from a microservices-based architecture to a modular monolith.

My experience at SSW highlights my ability to lead complex projects, mentor and train developers, and drive successful software modernization efforts.
