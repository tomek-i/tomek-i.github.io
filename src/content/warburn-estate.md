As a Software Engineer at a winery, I transformed the way the company operates by automating manual processes and digitizing data for better insights. By setting up and maintaining networks, I enabled seamless communication between teams and facilitated collaboration. I also had the opportunity to research, design and write new software programs that met the unique needs of the organization.

Working closely with users and managers, I developed software solutions that drove significant improvements in productivity and efficiency. Through my efforts, I was able to make machine data and key company information more accessible, leading to better reporting and data-driven decision-making.

Overall, I'm proud to have played a key role in the winery's digital transformation, and I'm excited to bring my skills and experience to new challenges in the future.
