I focused on the maintenance and improvement of SuperOffice-CRM-Modules, as well as the development of custom solutions to meet client requirements. I worked closely with users to identify pain points and bottlenecks within the system, and then develop and improve components within the CRM.

By leveraging my experience in development, I was able to create customized solutions that helped clients streamline their processes, increase efficiency, and enhance their overall productivity.
