In my role, I successfully managed a diverse portfolio of over 30 website clients. I was responsible for hosting and maintaining their websites, ensuring regular maintenance checks, performing necessary security upgrades, updating content, and enhancing website functionality as required.

The websites I developed for our clients were primarily based on Joomla and CMS platforms. With a keen focus on providing exceptional service, I maintained strong relationships with over 60 clients, the majority of whom entrusted us with their hosting needs. My responsibilities included proactive security monitoring and ensuring all components remained up to date.
