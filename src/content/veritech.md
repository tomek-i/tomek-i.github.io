As an IT professional, I specialized in server and network development and maintenance, as well as website development. I worked closely with clients to understand their unique requirements and developed custom IT and network solutions to meet their needs.

I was managing over 30 website clients which were hosted by us or we maintained their hosting on their behalf. Responsibilities included regular maintenance checks and upgrades to ensure security, content updates, redesigning the website or extending its functionality.

The websites were build on Wordpress and Joomla.s
