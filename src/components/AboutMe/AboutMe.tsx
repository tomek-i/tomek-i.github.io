          Hi, I'm <strong>{settings.profile.name}</strong>, a software developer
          based in Australia. Originally from Poland, I moved to Germany at a
          young age and pursued my passion for computers with a three-year
          course at Rheinische Akademie K√∂ln in Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I have acquired over{' '}
          <strong>{new Date().getFullYear() - 2009}</strong> years of experience
          in the software development industry. My expertise lies in{' '}
          <strong>C# .NET, TypeScript, React, Node.js, MSSQL</strong>.
          Throughout my career I have worked with different techstacks and
          frameworks,{' '}
          <strong>
            Python, Django, Express, Strapi, Angular, PHP, Laravel, Wordpress,
            Terraform.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2009, I made Australia my home and became a citizen soon after.
          When I'm not coding, you can find me{' '}
          <strong>still coding üòÖ, at the beach üèñÔ∏è or traveling</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in working with me, please don't hesitate to{' '}
          <button onClick={() => setShowContactFormModal(true)}>
            <span className="underline underline-offset-4">reach out</span>{' '}
