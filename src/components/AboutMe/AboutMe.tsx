          Hi, I'm <strong>Thomas Iwainski</strong>, a software developer based
          in Australia. Originally from Poland, I moved to Germany at a young
          age and pursued my passion for computers with a three-year course at
          Rheinische Akademie KÃ¶ln in Germany.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2009, I made Australia my home and became a citizen soon after.
