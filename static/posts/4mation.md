As a Full-Stack Developer at 4mation, I was instrumental in developing and maintaining web applications across a range of technologies, including TypeScript, AngularJS, Next.js, Node.js, and Express.js. My role involved not only writing code but also leading the successful migration of legacy systems to modern, scalable serverless architectures.

I worked in a dynamic Agile environment, where I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that our software solutions met and often exceeded client expectations. I played a key role in gathering requirements, defining project scope, and delivering projects on time and within budget.

One of my notable achievements was leading a project to modernize a legacy VB.NET application, transitioning it to a robust .NET 8 platform. My ability to mentor junior developers, conduct thorough code reviews, and uphold high standards in software development contributed significantly to the team's success. I am passionate about continuous learning and stayed ahead of industry trends, which allowed me to bring innovative solutions to the table.
